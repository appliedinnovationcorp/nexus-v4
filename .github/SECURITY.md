# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The Nexus Workspace project takes security seriously. We have implemented comprehensive security measures throughout our development and deployment pipeline to ensure the safety and integrity of our applications and infrastructure.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes multiple layers of security scanning:

#### 1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Comprehensive static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Languages Covered**: JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Vulnerability Types**: XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal, and more
- **Frequency**: On every push and pull request

#### 2. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**
- **npm audit**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated security updates for dependencies
- **Severity Threshold**: High and Critical vulnerabilities block merges
- **Frequency**: Weekly automated scans + on every push

#### 3. **Container Security Scanning**
- **Trivy**: Comprehensive container vulnerability scanning
- **Base Image Scanning**: Regular updates to secure base images
- **Severity Threshold**: Critical vulnerabilities block deployment
- **Frequency**: On every container build

#### 4. **Infrastructure Security**
- **Checkov**: Terraform security best practices scanning
- **AWS Security**: IAM policies, security groups, encryption validation
- **Compliance**: CIS benchmarks and security standards
- **Frequency**: On infrastructure changes

#### 5. **Secret Detection**
- **TruffleHog**: Advanced secret scanning in code and git history
- **Pattern Detection**: API keys, passwords, tokens, certificates
- **Prevention**: Blocks commits containing secrets
- **Frequency**: On every push and pull request

#### 6. **Docker Security**
- **Hadolint**: Dockerfile security best practices
- **Image Scanning**: Multi-layer vulnerability analysis
- **Runtime Security**: Security policies and constraints
- **Frequency**: On every Docker build

### Security Gates

#### Merge Protection
- **Branch Protection**: Main and develop branches are protected
- **Required Checks**: All security scans must pass before merge
- **Review Requirements**: Security-sensitive changes require review
- **Status Checks**: Automated security gate enforcement

#### Deployment Gates
- **Staging Validation**: All code must pass staging security tests
- **Production Deployment**: Requires successful staging validation
- **Zero-Downtime**: Blue-green deployments with security validation
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback on security failures

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
3. **DO** email security details to: [security@nexus-workspace.com](mailto:security@nexus-workspace.com)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your security report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Affected versions, components, or environments
- **Proof of Concept**: Code, screenshots, or other evidence (if applicable)

### Response Timeline

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly:

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours of report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 30 days for critical issues

## üîß Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent XSS
- **Authentication**: Use secure authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
- **Cryptography**: Use established cryptographic libraries
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

#### Dependency Management
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Run `pnpm audit` regularly
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies
- **License Compliance**: Ensure license compatibility

#### Secret Management
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration
- **Secret Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and passwords
- **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive information

### For Infrastructure

#### AWS Security
- **IAM Policies**: Follow principle of least privilege
- **Encryption**: Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- **Network Security**: Use VPCs, security groups, and NACLs
- **Monitoring**: Enable CloudTrail and CloudWatch logging
- **Backup**: Regular automated backups with encryption

#### Container Security
- **Base Images**: Use official, minimal base images
- **Regular Updates**: Keep base images and packages updated
- **Non-Root User**: Run containers as non-root users
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource constraints
- **Network Policies**: Implement network segmentation

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring

- **Real-time Alerts**: Automated alerts for security events
- **Log Analysis**: Centralized logging and analysis
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based threat detection
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous compliance validation

### Security Metrics

We track the following security metrics:

- **Vulnerability Resolution Time**: Average time to fix vulnerabilities
- **Security Scan Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by security scans
- **False Positive Rate**: Accuracy of security scanning tools
- **Security Training**: Developer security training completion rates
