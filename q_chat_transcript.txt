• @nexus/analytics: Needs React/JSX plugin for Rollup to handle .tsx files
• @nexus/copilot-demo: TypeScript issues with Express middleware types
• @nexus/backend: NestJS build dependency issues

Then move on to providing 100% test coverage end-to-end for all packages, apps, etc. Implement E2E testing setup.

Complete Pending Package Implementations
1. Fix Analytics Package Build
  
bash
   # Add React plugin to analytics rollup config
   cd packages/analytics && pnpm add -D @rollup/plugin-react
   


2. Fix Copilot Demo TypeScript Issues
  bash
   # Update Express types and middleware configuration
   

3. Add Basic Test Files
  bash
   # Create basic test files for core packages
   

Set Up Local Development Database
1. Database Setup
  bash
   pnpm db:setup
   

2. Environment Configuration
  bash
   # Copy and configure environment files
   cp .env.example .env
   

Configure Monitoring and Logging
1. Development Monitoring
   • Set up local Sentry configuration
   • Configure development logging levels
   • Set up health check endpoints

3. Production Readiness

Review and Test Deployment Pipelines
• Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows (25+ workflows)
• Multi-environment deployment configs
• Security scanning and policy enforcement
• Branch protection and code review processes

Validate Security Configurations
• CodeQL security scanning
• Dependency vulnerability scanning
• Security policy enforcement workflows
• Secret management infrastructure

Set Up Monitoring Dashboards
• Infrastructure monitoring with Terraform/Pulumi
• Application performance monitoring
• Business metrics and analytics dashboards

Set up local development database
Configure environment variables for development
